# Simple AWS Environment Management 

[awsenv][] lets you easily switch between multiple [AWS][] environments. It's
simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tool that
do one thing well.

[awsenv][] is heavily inspired by [rbenv][] from [sstephenson][].

## How it works

[awsenv][] operates on the per-user directory `~/.awsenv`. Environments in
[awsenv][] correspond to subdirectories of `~/.awsenv/envs`. For example, you
might have `~/.awsenv/envs/acme-corporation` and `~/.awsenv/envs/private`.

## Installation

### Basic checkout

1. Check out [awsenv][] into `~/.awsenv`.

        $ git clone git://github.com/michaelcontento/awsenv.git "$HOME/.awsenv"

2. Add `~/.awsenv/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to the [awsenv][] command-line
utility.

        $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.awsenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

    **Zsh note:** Modify your `~/.zshenv` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

3. Add `awsenv init` to your shell to load the default environment.

        $ echo 'eval "$(awsenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile

    **Zsh note:** Modify your `~/.zshenv` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

4. Restart your shell so the path changes take effect. You can now begin using
[awsenv][].

        $ exec $SHELL

### Upgrading

If you've installed [awsenv][] using the instructions above, you can upgrade 
your installation at any time using [git][].

To upgrade to the latest development version of [awsenv][], use `git pull`:

    $ cd ~/.awsenv
    $ git pull

Or use the builtin update command:

    $ awsenv update

To upgrade to a specific release of [awsenv][], check out the corresponding tag:

    $ cd ~/.awsenv
    $ git fetch
    $ git tag
    0.1.0
    0.2.0
    $ git checkout 0.2.0

## Usage

Like [git][], the [awsenv][] command delegates to subcommands based on its first
argument. The most common subcommands are:

### awsenv init

This is the only command that will modify your current shell. Here is what this
command does:

1. Exposes the usage of [awsenv][] to the world with the variables described
below
2. Configures various variables required by the [AWS][] tools:
    * Credential variables (e.g. `AWS_CREDENTIAL_FILE`)
    * Variables regarding the used identity file (e.g. `AWS_IDENTITY_FILE`)
3. Add the used identity file to the `ssh-agent`

Run `awsenv init -` for yourself to see exactly what happens under the hood.

The special name `-` tells [awsenv][] to use the environment selected with
`awsenv use` previously.

[awsenv][] expose it's presence to the outside world with the following 
variables:

* `AWSENV_LOADED=1` indicates that [awsenv][] is loaded properly
* `AWSENV_NAME` contains the name of the currently used environment

### awsenv use

Set the global environment name to be used in all shells by writing the name to
the `~/.awsenv/default` file.

    $ awsenv use acme-corporation

All environments are stored as seperate directory in `~/.awsenv/env`.

### awsenv list

Display a list of all currently installed environments.

    $ awsenv list

### awsenv import

This command helps you to import environments into [awsenv][]. Just read the 
help of this command, checkout the [awsenv-example-env][] repository and you 
should be able to setup all required files without any problems.

    $ awsenv import git git://github.com/michaelcontento/awsenv-example-env.git example

Import also supports importing your local ` ~/.aws/credentials ` file which is being used by [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/). It only supports importing your keys at the moment.

    $ awsenv import local

You can help to expand this list by simply creating a new executable named
`awsenv-import-<TYPE>`. Pull requests are welcome!

## Development

The [awsenv][] source code is hosted on [GitHub][]. It's clean, modular, and 
easy to understand, even if you're not a shell hacker.
